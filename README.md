# fnbr.co translations

UI Translations for [fnbr.co](https://fnbr.co). As of now it is *not* planned to translate all Fortnite cosmetics due to volume.

## How can I contribute?

Create a pull request with your changes, language files are named `[two-letter code].json`, you can find a list of two letter language codes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).  
For example `en.json` for English, `es.json` for Spanish, `pt.json` for Portuguese and so on.

If a string does not exist in the file it will default to English.  

In your pull request tell us your Discord name and discriminator and we will give your [fnbr.co account](https://fnbr.co/oauth) no adverts and credit your GitHub as a thank you.
